## My process

In this challenge, I started as usual by measuring the layout, then coded the HTML script, and followed by doing the CSS styling. I started programming the JS script as soon as I finished my mobile styling. After done with Javascript, I continued to desktop styling.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

In this challenge I learned how to create an accordion feature. I also custimized by not only opening and closing one tab, but also closed the tab as I open another one. I also learned how to deal with images.
